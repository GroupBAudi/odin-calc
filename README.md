# odin-calc

Hello fellow Odin Students!

This is a simple calculator made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It has around 300 lines of codes to make it work. Although it works, I am not particularly proud of this 'creation'. If you decided to dissect the script file, you'll be 100% disappointed since I use lots of 'if-statements' in order to make it work, which I feel it's not the right way to create a calculator.  There has to be a way better than this right?  If this is a school assignment, I would at least got B if the professor is generous enough.

Did you encounter any bug? Please tell me in the comments so I can stop further embarrassing my self. Thank you for your time to read this!

Useless trivia: 
- It took me 3 months to create this thing, mostly because of my work and college final test
- This looks like Windows 10 default calculator layout, but has no 'memory' because I don't understand it even though I regularly use calculator in my work.
- The brand OSC-15 means Odin Simple Calculator 15 maximum length.

I hope you find this 'calculator' at the very least inspiring to be an example on how NOT to create a calculator. Thank you for your time to view this!
